\section{Tracking}{
\label{Sect:Tracking}

MICE detectors were used to track particles across more than 15\,m of instrumented beamline and cooling channel, from the first TOF station up the EMR.
High resolution particle tracking was provided by the two Trackers (section~\ref{Sect:Tracker}), while the combined use of TOF stations and Trackers was used for a precise alignment of the latter inside the superconducting magnets (section~\ref{Sect:DA}).
Comparison of reconstructed and extrapolated tracks between detectors estimated the overall performances of the detectors (section~\ref{Sect:TM}).
