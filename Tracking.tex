\section{Tracking}{
\label{Sect:Tracking}

Particle were tracked across more than 15\,m of instrumented beamline and cooling channel, from the first TOF station to the EMR.
High resolution particle tracking was provided by the two trackers (section~\ref{Sect:Tracker}), while the combined use of TOF stations and trackers was used for a precise alignment of the latter inside the superconducting magnets (section~\ref{Sect:DA}).
%Comparison of reconstructed and extrapolated tracks between detectors was used to estimate the overall performances of the detectors (section~\ref{Sect:TM}).
