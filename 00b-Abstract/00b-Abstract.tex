\end{center}

Muon beams of low emittance provide the basis for the intense, well characterised neutrino beams of a neutrino factory and for multi-TeV lepton-antilepton collisions at a muon collider. The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) has demonstrated ionization cooling, the technique by which it is proposed to reduce the  phase-space volume occupied by the muon beam. This paper will describe the detectors used in the experiment, their performances and how they have been used as a full comprehensive diagnostic system, including the liquid hydrogen absorber installed for the emittance reduction measurements.
