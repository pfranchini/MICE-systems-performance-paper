\abstract{Muon beams of low emittance provide the basis for the intense,
well-characterised neutrino beams of a neutrino factory and for
multi-TeV lepton-antilepton collisions at a muon collider.
The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) has
demonstrated the principle of ionization cooling, the technique by
which it is proposed to reduce the phase-space volume occupied by the
muon beam at such facilities. 
This paper documents the performance of the detectors used in MICE
to measure the muon-beam parameters and the physical properties at run-time of the liquid hydrogen absorber.
