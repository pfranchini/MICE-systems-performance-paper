\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sect:Conclusions}

A complete set of particle detector have permitted the full characterisation and study of the evolution of the phase space of a muon beam through a section of a cooling channel, leading to the first measurement of ionization cooling with unique level of precision and detail.
All the different elements of the MICE instrumentation have been used to characterise the beam and the measurement of the cooling performance for a different variety of beams momenta, emittance, and absorbers.
Proving a technique critical for a muon collider and a neutrino factory brings those facilities a step closer.
