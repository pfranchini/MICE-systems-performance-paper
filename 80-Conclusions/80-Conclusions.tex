\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sect:Conclusions}

A complete set of particle detector have permitted the full characterisation and study of the evolution of the phase space of a muon beam through a section of a cooling channel, leading to the first measurement of ionization cooling with unique level of precision and detail.
The PID performance of the detectors is summarised in table~\ref{tab:pid}.

\end{table}

All the different elements of the MICE instrumentation have been used to characterise the beam and the measurement of the cooling performance for a different variety of beams momenta, emittance, and absorbers.
Proving a technique critical for a muon collider and a neutrino factory brings those facilities a step closer.
