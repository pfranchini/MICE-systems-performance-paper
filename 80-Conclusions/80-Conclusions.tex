\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sect:Conclusions}

A complete set of particle detector have permitted the full characterization and study of the evolution of a muon beam through a demonstrative section of a cooling channel, leading to the first measurement of ionization cooling with unique level of precision and detail.
All the different elements of the MICE instrumented beamline have contributed to characterize the beam and are leading to further measurements to increase the precision of the measurement of the cooling performance for a different variety of beams momenta, emittance, and absorbers.
Proving a technique critical for a muon collider and a neutrino factory brings those facilities a step closer.
