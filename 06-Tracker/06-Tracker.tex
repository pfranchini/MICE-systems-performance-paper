\section{Trackers}
\label{Sect:Tracker}

\subsection{Introduction}
MICE was equipped with two identical, high precision scintillating-fibre trackers, described in~\cite{Ellis:2010bb}. One tracker, TKU, was upstream of the cooling cell, the other, TKD, was downstream, the mirror image of TKU as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BL}.
Each tracker was placed in a superconducting solenoid (SSU and SSD, upstream and downstream respectively) designed to provide a uniform magnetic field over the tracking volume.

The trackers were 110\,cm in length and 30\,cm in diameter (see figure~\ref{Figure:FullTracker}). There were five stations per tracker (labelled 1 to 5, with station 1 being closest to the cooling cell) held in position using a carbon-fibre space-frame. The stations sit at different distances in $z$ (beam axis) of 20--35\,cm: this ensured that the azimuthal rotation of track position from one station to the next differs, difference being important in the resolving ambiguities at the pattern-recognition stage. Each tracker was instrumented with an internal LED calibration system and four 3-axis Hall probes to monitor the field.

Bundles of seven 350\,$\mu$m fibres were grouped together, to be read out by 1\,mm scintillating fibre light guides.}

The tracker stations consisted of three doublet layers of 350\,$\mu$m scintillating fibres, these layers were arranged such that each was at an angle of 120$^\circ$ with respect to the next. This arrangement ensured that there were no inactive regions between adjacent fibres. Bundles of seven fibres were grouped into a single readout channel (this reduced the number of readout channels, while maintaining a sufficient spatial resolution). The trackers had a spatial resolution per doublet layer of 470\,$\mu$m and an expected light yield of approximately 10 photo-electrons.

The light from the seven scintillating fibres passed into a single clear fibre, which took it to a visible light photon counter (VLPC) which operated at 9\,k. The signals from the VLPCs were digitised using electronics developed by the D0 collaboration~\cite{Abazov:2005pn}.


\subsection{Performance and Reconstruction}

Each of the 15 tracker planes (three per station and five stations) consisted of 214 channels, labelled 0--213, likewise each plane was assigned an integer plane number 0--2. Particle signals were recorded by the tracker electronics and calibrated channel by channel then converted into signal NPE. This information was then used to form a digit and was the first step in tracker reconstruction.
Digit profiles were useful in identifying and rectifying or removing hot or dead channels in the planes and ensuring the accuracy of calibration.  Smooth centrally peaked spectra were expected in a plane with no dead channels and minimal electronics noise, but this was not an essential requirement, since it was the combination of two or three planes which go to make a point in the track and so there was redundancy built in. Hence a significant fraction of individual channels can be lost without a knock on drop in efficiency. 
The clustering algorithm looped over every combination of pairs of digits in a single event and combined any that occur in neighbouring channels. In the case of a multi-digit cluster, the unweighted average channel value was used to define the plane coordinate and the NPE was summed.

For each station the constituent planes were searched for clusters that can be used to form a spacepoint.
Spacepoints were constructed from clusters from all three planes (a triplet spacepoint) or from any two out of the three planes (a doublet spacepoint).

\subsubsection{Noise}
%Noise at electronics level discussion, 1/2 page, and Noise from data, 1/2 page.
The scintillating fibre trackers operated by registering digits above a given NPE threshold within each fibre plane. Fibres were collected into channels as ganged bundles of 7 for each channel, with digits registered per channel instead of per fibre. From a coincidence of digit events in 2 or 3 oblique channels (fibres in differing planes), a spacepoint was reconstructed, from which track reconstruction can occur. We considered noise in the tracker to be those digits registered not from the passage of a beam particle, but instead from other sources, for instance, dark current from thermal electron emission in the VLPCs. To isolate noise from signal during beam-on data collection, a strict cut can be made requiring that only events with one fitted track and 5 spacepoints per tracker were selected, with all 5 spacepoints included in the fitted track. All digits corresponding to the track were then removed from the total set of digits for that event, and the remainder were considered noise digits. An in-situ approximation of active channels for the current data-taking period was made, assuming all channels without at least one registered digit in the selected data-taking run were inactive. The average noise rate per channel per event was then calculated as the total number of event digits above the considered NPE threshold in each tracker, divided by both the active channel number and the number of events satisfying the above selection criteria. This gave a value of 0.18\% upstream and 0.06\% downstream for events above 2\,NPE. 

\subsubsection{Track Finding Efficiency}
\label{trackers:performance:efficiency}
%Track selection/Kalman, efficiency (from all data runs plotted by pt and if all equal just 10mm can be shown) resolution (from MC), reference MAUS and Tracker SW paper, 1 page, Chris H.
Data were analysed in order to determine the track and spacepoint finding efficiency of the detectors during running conditions. A time-of-flight cut was used to ensure that each measured track had a time-of-flight consistent with a muon throughout the entire experimental apparatus. A hit was therefore required in each of the TOF1 and TOF2 detectors, which ensured that the particle must have been successfully transmitted through the cooling channel, crossing both tracking detectors. These requirements ensured that there was a better then 99.9\% probability that a particle will have traversed a tracking detector.
The number of events missing a track was therefore measured and used to estimate the efficiency of the detector.
The results of the efficiency analysis were tabulated in table~\ref{Table:tracker_efficiency_results} for a range of momentum and nominal emittances. A track-finding efficiency of 98.70\% was reported for the upstream tracker and 98.93\% for the downstream tracker, averaged over field and beam conditions. Additionally, assuming a track was found, the probability of successfully finding each spacepoint is summarised in table~\ref{Table:tracker_spacepoint_efficiency_results}. The overall efficiency of both trackers was sufficient to not present any significant systematic uncertainties in the analysis, however it was lower than the ideal expectation, 99.9\% efficiency, due to the presence of dead channels, an unavoidable inaccuracy of the construction process.

\subsubsection{Track Fit Predicted Performance}

Monte Carlo simulation used with realistic field and beam conditions in order to estimate the reconstruction performance. A beam centred at 140\,MeV/$c$ with 10\,mm nominal emittance, representing a typical data set, was used for the study of emittance evolution.
Results are presented in figure~\ref{trackers:performance:resolutions:up} for the upstream tracker and figure~\ref{trackers:performance:resolutions:down} for the downstream tracker.

\subsection{Efficiency evolution}

The efficiency of the tracker was processed over the lifetime of its use during the data taking. The analysis used in section~\ref{trackers:performance:efficiency} was repeated and automated for runs starting in 2015.
The selection of events used in the analysis included two more constraints, as generally required in most of the analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a spacepoint was required to be reconstructed within the tracker volume using a radial cut, and
  \item only a single spacepoint was reconstructed in each of the stations.
\end{enumerate}

The evolution of the straight and helical track finding efficiency in the upstream and downstream trackers is shown in figure~\ref{fig:trackers:performance:historical}, showing efficiencies generally above 99.0\%. The variation in efficiency over time was primary due the loss of VLPC channels from moisture infiltration into the system and then partial recovery with drying.
